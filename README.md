# Broco's Uni Material!

Welcome to a collection of all the material of my Cybersecurity Master Degree at the University of Pisa.

## What does this repository contains?

On this repository, you will find all the notes I took during classes held in 2024-2025, written directly on the slides provided by the professors. For certain courses, you will also find exercises I did to prepare for written exams, or links to the repositories of projects that were made by me and other colleagues.

Of course, I do not own any of the slides as they were made by the professors of the courses. If you are their creator and want the notes removed, you can contact me at brocolaco5678@gmail.com. The material has been published just to offer help to fellow students of the course.

## How do I interpret the notes?

In some cases, the notes are divided in Weekly clusters. If you want to go in chronological order, follow the indexes on the file names. For example, the first PDF of the weekly lecture will be named "1 Lecture_Name.pdf". If multiple PDFs were presented during a lecture, you will find an enumeration like "1.1 Lecture_Name.pdf" and "1.2 Lecture_Name.pdf".

Also note that, when you see empty slides (no written notes or highlighting) in the PDFs, this means that they were either skipped or they are annotated in another PDF (this applies to the Weekly clusters divided notes). This mainly happens when a PDF was started in one lecture and ended in the next or the following ones.

Some notes or exercises were taken in italian, but this applies to the vast minority of the cases. I apologize for the inconvenience for any international students.
