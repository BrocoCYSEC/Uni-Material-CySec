# Broco's Uni Material!

Welcome to a collection of all the material collected in my Cybersecurity Master Degree at University of Pisa.

## What does this repository contains?

On this repository, you will find all the notes I took during classes, written directly on the slides provided by the professors. For certain courses, you will also find exercises I did to prepare for written exams, or links to the repositories of projects that were made by me and other colleagues.
Of course, I do not own the slides as they were made by the professors of the courses. If you are their creator and want the notes removed, you can contact me at brocolaco5678@gmail.com. The material has been published just to offer help to fellow students of the course.

## How do I interpret the notes?

In some cases, the notes are divided in Weekly clusters. If you want to go in chronological order, follow the indexes of the file. For example, the first PDF of the lecture will be named "1 Lecture_Name.pdf". If multiple PDFs were presented during a lecture, you will find an enumeration like "1.1 Lecture_Name.pdf" and "1.2 Lecture_Name.pdf".
Also note that, when you see empty slides (no notes or highlighting), the slides were either skipped or they are annotated in another PDF (this applies to the Weekly clusters divided notes). This mainly happens when a PDF was started in one lecture and ended in the next or the following ones.
Note that some notes or exercises were taken in italian, but this is the vast minority of the cases. I apologize for the inconvenience for any international student.
